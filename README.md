# Little About me and this Project

I love playing games. I had started played games since i was 10. It was some
old potato pc but it ran Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas perfectly.Since then i
love games. Thats why i have taken computer science,i.e to make games and do
advanced computers stuff. So when Monika Ma,am gave us project. Idea struck
into my mind ,that idea was ...why not i learn and make a game. Then i gathered
2 more of my friends and We thought we would make a decent open world
fighting game but when we researched about making game in python. We got to
know about pygame module. It already defined some helpful functions to make
a decent game. So we read documentation of pygame, although didnt
understand anything but we then learned making a simple snakegame from
codewithharry youtubechannel. And the end product was really bad and my
respect increased for game developers that how they make such good games
but then they don’t get paid enough for it. People pirate their games! Which is
really bad and sad.
